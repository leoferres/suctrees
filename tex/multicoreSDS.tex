A weak point of succinct data structures is their construction time,
which is generally quite slow compared to the construction time of
traditional ``pointer-linked'' data structures. We have been working
on improving construction time for succinct data structures
\cite{Fuentes2014}. In that paper, two practical multicore algorithms
for wavelet tree construction were introduced. Both algorithms run
have $O(n\lg \sigma)$ {\em work} time and $O(n)$ {\em span}, where $n$
is the input size and $\sigma$ is the alphabet size. In
\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/Shun14}, Shun introduced 3 new algorithms to
construct wavelet trees in parallel. The best algorithm, in practice,
has $O(n\lg \sigma)$ {\em work} time and $O(\lg n\lg \sigma)$ {\em
span}. Shun also explain how to parallelize the construction of
rank/select structures, taking $O(n)$ {\em work} time and $O(1)$ {\em
span} for rank structures and $O(n)$ {\em work} time and $O(\lg n)$
{\em span} for select structures. The author does not provide an
implementation of its proposal.
