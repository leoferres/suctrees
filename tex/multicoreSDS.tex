A weak point of succinct data structures is their construction time, which is generally quite slow compared with the construction time of traditional ``pointer linked" data structures. In the last time, a new research line has emerged to improve the construction performance of succinct data structures using multicore architectures. As far as we know, the work on \cite{Fuentes2014} is the first work in that research line. Fuentes-Sep\'ulveda et al. introduced two practical multicore algorithms for wavelet tree construction. Both algorithms run have $O(n\lg \sigma)$ {\em work} time and $O(n)$ {\em span}, where $n$ is the input size and $\sigma$ is the alphabet size. In \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/Shun14}, Shun introduced 3 new algorithms to construct wavelet trees in parallel. The best algorithm, in practice, has $O(n\lg \sigma)$ {\em work} time and $O(\lg n\lg \sigma)$ {\em span}. Shun also explain how to parallelize the construction of rank/select structures, taking $O(n)$ {\em work} time and $O(1)$ {\em span} for rank structures and $O(n)$ {\em work} time and $O(\lg n)$ {\em span} for select structures. The author does not provide an implementation of its proposal.
