In this paper, we demonstrated that it is possible to improve the construction
time of succinct trees using multicore parallelism.
We introduced a practical algorithm that takes $O(n/p+\lg p)$ time to construct
a succinct representation of a tree with $n$ nodes using $p$ threads.
This representation supports a rich set of navigational operations in $O(\lg n)$
time.
Our algorithm substantially outperformed state-of-the-art sequential
constructions of this data structure, achieved very good speed-up up to 64
cores, and is to the best of our knowledge the first parallel construction
algorithm of a succinct tree representation.

While we focused on representing static trees succinctly in this paper, the
approach we have taken may also extend to the construction of dynamic succinct
trees (e.g., \cite{Navarro:2014:FFS:2620785.2601073}), of succinct
representations of labelled trees, and of other succinct data structures that
use succinct trees as building blocks (e.g., the succinct representation of
planar graphs).
