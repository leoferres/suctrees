In this paper, we demonstrated that it is possible to improve the construction
time of succinct trees using multicore parallelism.
We introduced a practical algorithm that takes $O(n/p+\lg p)$ time to construct
a succinct representation of a tree with $n$ nodes using $p$ threads.
This representation supports a rich set of operations in $O(\lg n)$ time.
Our algorithm substantially outperformed state-of-the-art sequential
constructions of this data structure, achieved very good speed-up up to 64
cores, and is to the best of our knowledge the first parallel construction
algorithm of a succinct representation of ordinal trees.

While we focused on representing static trees succinctly in this paper, the
approach we have taken may also extend to the construction of \emph{dynamic}
succinct trees (e.g., \cite{Navarro:2014:FFS:2620785.2601073}), of succinct
representations of \emph{labelled} trees, and of other succinct data structures
that use succinct trees as building blocks (e.g., the succinct representation of
planar graphs).
