To evaluate the performance of our {\tt PSTA} algorithm, we compare it against
{\tt libcds}~\cite{libcds}\Norbert{The original URL of libcds.recoded.cl seems
  to be dead.
  Is this the same as the one I put into the reference now?} and {\tt
  sdsl}~\cite{sdsl}.
Both libraries implement the {\tt RMMT} that\Norbert{If there is only one RMMT
  variant, with $O(\lg n)$ query time, then this should be ``, which''.}
supports navigational operations in $O(\lg N)$ time.
They also assume that the input tree is given as a parenthesis sequence, as we
do here.
Our implementation of the {\tt PSTA} algorithm deviates from the description in
Section~\ref{subsec:multicoreSTAlgorithm} in that the prefix sum computation in
line~27 of the algorithm is done sequentially in our implementation.
This changes the running time of the algorithm to $O(N/p + p)$ but simplifies the
implementation.
Since $p \ll N/p$ for the input sizes we are interested in and the numbers of
processors available on current multicore systems, this simplification has an
insignificant impact on the running time of our algorithm.
