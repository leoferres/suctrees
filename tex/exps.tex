To compare the implementation of our {\tt PSTA} algorithm, we use has baselines {\tt libcds}\footnote{\url{http://libcds.recoded.cl}. We thank Diego Arroyuelo
for the conversations about the implementation of succinct
trees} and {\tt sdsl}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/simongog/sdsl-lite}} libraries. Both libraries implement the {\tt RMMT} which supports navigational operations in $O(\lg N)$ time. They also assume as input a tree represented as a parentheses sequence. For simplicity, we implement the parallel prefix sum algorithm needed in Algorithm \ref{algo:PSTA1} (line 27) has a sequential algorithm. Since that, on current machines, $ p \ll N$, change the term $\lg p$ into $p$ is not an issue.
