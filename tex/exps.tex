To evaluate the performance of our {\tt PSTA} algorithm, we compare it against
{\tt libcds}~\cite{libcds} and {\tt sdsl}~\cite{sdsl}, which are
state-of-the-art implementations of the {\tt RMMT}.
Both assume that the input tree is given as a parenthesis sequence, as we do
here.
Our implementation of the {\tt PSTA} algorithm deviates from the description in
Section~\ref{subsec:multicoreSTAlgorithm} in that the prefix sum computation in
line~27 of the algorithm is done sequentially in our implementation.
This changes the running time to $O(n/p + p)$ but simplifies the implementation.
Since $p \ll n/p$ for the input sizes we are interested in and the numbers of
processors available on current multicore systems, the impact on the running
time is insignificant.
