{\tt PSTA} was implemented in the C programming language and
compiled using GCC 4.9 using the -O2 and -ffast-math flags. The same flags was used
to {\tt libcds} and {\tt sdsl}. The experiments were carried out on a quad-processor AMD Opteron\texttrademark{} Processor 6278
	 with eight cores per processor, for a total of 32 physical cores
running at 2.40GHz. Hyperthreading was abled. The computer runs
Linux 3.11.0-26-generic, in 64-bit mode. This machine has per-core L1
and L2 caches of sizes 64KB and 2048KB, respectively and a
per-processor shared L3 cache of 6MB, with a 189GB DDR
RAM memory. Algorithms were compared in terms of running times using
the usual high-resolution (nanosecond) C functions in {\tt
  <time.h>}.\footnote{This is a reproducible-research-friendly paper,
