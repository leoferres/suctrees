We implemented the {\tt PSTA} algorithm in C and compiled it using GCC 4.9 with
optimization level -O2 and using the \mbox{-ffast-math flag}.\footnote{The code
  and data needed to replicate our results are available at
  \url{http://www.inf.udec.cl/~josefuentes/spaa2015}.}
All parallel code was compiled using the GCC Cilk branch.
The same flags were used to compile {\tt libcds} and {\tt sdsl}, which were
written in C++.

The experiments were carried out on a machine with four AMD
Opteron\texttrademark{} 6278 processors clocked at 2.4GHz,
with 8 cores per processor, 64KB of L1 cache per core, 2MB of L2 cache per core,
and 6MB of shared L3 cache.
In total, we had 32 cores at our disposal.
The machine had 189GB of DDR\Norbert{What kind?  Clock speed?} RAM.

The running times of the algorithms were measured using
the high-resolution (nanosecond) C functions in {\tt <time.h>}.
Memory consumption was measured using the tools provided by
{\tt malloc\_count} \cite{malloc-count}.

In our experiments, the chunk size $s$ and the arity $k$ were fixed at 256 and
2, respectively.
