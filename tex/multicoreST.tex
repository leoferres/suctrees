We will focus on polylogarithmic-size trees because they are the only
ones that have an implementation we can compare ourselves to; in
particular, we take the {\tt
libcds}\footnote{\url{http://libcds.recoded.cl}. We thank Diego
Arroyuelo for the conversations about the implementation of succinct
trees.} and {\tt
sdsl}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/simongog/sdsl-lite}} libraries
as state-of-the-art and our sequential baseline.

\Jose{In this section I'll use the same notation used in
\cite{Navarro:2014:FFS:2620785.2601073}. This notation should be
introduced in the Related Work section}\\
