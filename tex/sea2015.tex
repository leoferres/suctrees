\begin{abstract}
Succinct representations of trees have been an elegant solution to make large trees fit in main memory while still supporting
navigational operations in constant time. However, the construction time of succinct trees remains a computational bottleneck. In this
paper, we introduce a practical parallel algorithm that improves the state of the art in succinct tree construction. Given a tree on
$n$ nodes stored as a sequence of balanced parentheses, the proposed algorithm can build a succinct tree representation in
$O(n/p+\lg p)$ time, where $p$ is the number of available processors. The constructed representation occupies $2n + o(n)$
bits of storage and supports a rich set of navigational operations in $O(\lg n)$ time. We tested the algorithm on a $64$-core
machine and on inputs of different sizes.
In these experiments, it achieved good parallel speedup.
We introduce another algorithm that takes $O(n/p + \lg p)$ time to construct
the balanced parenthesis representation of the input tree required by our
succinct tree construction algorithm.

implementation of succinct trees, Roberto As\'{i}n for letting us use
his machines to run our experiments, and finally Rodrigo C\'{a}novas
for helping us with reusing their data in
