Trees lie at the foundation of Computer Science. They are, according
to Knuth, one of the most important ``gifts'' from Computer Science to
mathematics. They are, as such, ubiquitous. We can find trees in every
aspect of everyday computing from the XML/HTML processing of web
browsers to ASTs in compilers. Still, with the advent of very large
amounts of hierarchical data, dealing with huge trees, particularly
their construction for in-memory querying, has become a processing
bottleneck. To solve this, succinct trees...

In this paper, we garner the power of multicore processors to help
with succinct tree construction.
